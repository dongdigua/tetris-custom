ape?
I want to port this piece of code to all platform,
but it is really too hard to me

I asked how to port programs that uses ncurses:
https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/issues/766

But there's another question:
how can I replace libbsd with `normal` function

custom features:
- reverse rotate
- smaller terminal
- pre-render the drop point
